like every kid i truly believe in santa claus and how magically he appears and gives me my sibling gift. but as i grew older and things actually started to make sense. i saw my parents and sometimes grandparents trying to hide presents near the christmas tree. same time to. there's no such thing a santa class or took very. it was really disappointing
